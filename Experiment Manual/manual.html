<h1>AMD Experiment Manual</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is a manual for the visual search experiment meant for patients with age-related macular
degeneration written by Julius Krumbiegel at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit&auml;t Munich in July 2016.</p>

<h2>Basic Setup</h2>

<h3>Hardware and Software</h3>

<h4>General</h4>

<p>The experiment is written in MATLAB (v. R2016a). It uses the freely available Psychtoolbox v3 (PTB) to display full-screen stimuli.
If the toolbox is not installed, the experiment cannot be run. All required code files are uploaded and maintained at
<a href="https://github.com/jkrumbiegel/lmu_amd">https://github.com/jkrumbiegel/lmu_amd</a>. File locations inside the project folder are described relative to the
chosen root folder (RF), e.g., <span class="filefolder">/RF/amdSearchExperiment/rotateCoordinates.m</span>.</p>

<h4>Computer</h4>
<p>The experiment was mainly coded and tested on a Dell Latitude E7450 laptop running Windows 7. It is not very CPU-demanding and should run on
most available hardware. For full compatibility with EyeLink eye trackers and for the synchronization with the MotionMonitor
via an Arduino, you need at least one free Ethernet and USB port, each, as well as some means to connect an external touch screen monitor.
In the test setup, the monitor was connected via VGA on the Dell's external docking station.</p>

<p>With the test setup and its Intel HD5500 graphics chip, PTB was not able to enable global anti-aliasing. To avoid jagged edges in stimuli and fixation patterns it
would be beneficial to run the experiment on a computer with a graphics card capable of anti-aliasing.</p>

<h4>Monitor</h4>

<p>For optimal performance, you should not use a setup where two monitors
are used in extended desktop mode. PTB will complain that flip timings for drawing new stimuli to the screen can't be kept
accurately. Single monitor or duplicate mode are fine.</p>

<p>The experiment has a mode where subjects are supposed to point to search stimuli on the screen. This can only work with a
touch screen monitor. So far, only the iiyama ProLite T2452MTS was tested with the experiment. Touch detection works by checking
if the cursor position changes from [0,0] to some other coordinate pair. Because no click needs to be registered, the pointing
detection can be triggered by moving the cursor with a mouse or trackpad. <span class="warning">Therefore, you need to ensure that neither you nor
the patient can move the mouse or trackpad during the experiment, but only touch the screen to give a response.</span> Otherwise,
you will get false positives.</p>

<p>Because PTB checks the monitor's resolution and calculates stimulus sizes relative to it, the experiment should be able to run
at basically any resolution. It was tested only at the iiyama's native resolution of 1920x1080px.</p>

<h4>Eye Tracking</h4>

<p>The experiment was written to work with the EyeLink 1000 eye tracking device. Because subject's are required to touch the
screen in most cases, the tower mount should be used instead of the desktop mount to keep the space in front of the cameras clear.</p>

<p>PTB comes with most of the files needed to work with the EyeLink system. But you are also required to install the EyeLink Developers Kit
and replace the standard Eyelink.mexa64 in the <span class="filefolder">/Psychtoolbox/Psychbasic/</span> folder. Both of these things can be downloaded from
the SR Research forums.</p>

<p>For calibration before eye tracking, the Eyelink toolbox accesses a file called <span class="filefolder">PsychEyelinkDispatchCallback.m</span> located in
<span class="filefolder">/Psychtoolbox/PsychHardware/EyelinkToolbox/EyelinkBasic/</span>. To be able to use custom modifications of the calibration stimulus to
enable AMD patients to fixate correctly, this file needs to be replaced with a modified version at
<span class="filefolder">/RF/EyelinkBasic/PsychEyelinkDispatchCallback.m</span>.</p>
